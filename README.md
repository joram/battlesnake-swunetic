Genetically training weight of snake heuristics

# Overview

## Comparing Snakes
This will, given a list of heuristics, run games with snakes of various weights against each other, and find a winner. For a list of snake configurations (weights for the heuristics), it will run 100 games, and return the count of wins for each of the configurations.

## Evolution
Given 100 sample games run with a set of snakes, a set of new snakes will be generated based on the winner(s) of the 100 games.
A certain amount of random varience will be introduced as well. This second generation of snakes, in theory, should be better than the first set of snakes.

## Repetition
Iterating on these snakes should give us better and better snake... profit?
